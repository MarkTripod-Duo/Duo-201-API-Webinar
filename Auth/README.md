### Script Descriptions

* [email_enroll_urls.py](email_enroll_urls.py) : This script demonstrates how the Duo Auth API can be used to enroll users and capture the activation URL that can be sent to the user separately to complete enrollment in Duo. This is an easy way for companies to automate the onboarding of new users while also maintaining control over how the activation information is delivered.
