### Script Descriptions

* [get_authentication_logs.py](get_authentication_logs.py) : This script provides a basic example of how the user authentication logs can be extracted using the Duo Admin API. The method to access the other log types is very similar and can be quickly replicated using this as a base example.
* [trust_monitor_events.py](trust_monitor_events.py) : This script shows an example of how to collect the available Duo Trust Monitor events that have been triggered.
